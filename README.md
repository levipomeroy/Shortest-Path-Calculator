# Shortest-Path-Calculator
This is a console application that implements Dijkstra's formula to find the shorest distance,
path, and estimated travel time between two vertices. 

It uses real cities, roads, and speed limits within Oregon to test its functionality.

This application operates by reading a comma-delimited file, parsing it into vertice and edge information,
and creating a graph (of my design). Then it prompts for the user to enter two vertice (city) names and it
finds the shortest path between them and estimates the time it would take to get there.
